# Rush-Symfony-4
One Week Rush with Symfony 4

Two person project using Symfony framework only. We used also AJAX to pass along information instantly between pages.

The goal was to use Symfony and an external API like MovieList, to create an application with account creation and 
connection that allow user to create a list of movies, add a movie to a specific list or just like the movie.
The website should also retrieve all the movie from the api and have a search function, to find a movie 
by name, author, genre or actor and add it to a list.
